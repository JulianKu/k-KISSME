for next week (20.11.)

Sonja -> Implementierung in R
Miro -> Constraints aus Dateinamen + Feature Extraction
Julian -> Feature Extraction

<<<<<<< HEAD
Generate Constraints:
- read samples from both sets of data that belong to same person
- make constraint array for must-links
- make constraint array for cannot-links
=======
Implementierung in R:
- Take code from Matlab
- Find corresponding functions in R
- (maybe compare outcomes with Matlab Demo to ensure correctness)
